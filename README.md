# Rising Roots

Rising Roots is an experimental regenerative farming lab that showcases future-forward
dashboards, blueprint libraries, and a commons marketplace for ecological operators.
The experience reimagines the original Dawning Harvest app into an entirely new product
with different flows, design language, and dependencies.

## Highlights

- **Pulse dashboard**: Soil vitality charts, organic matter telemetry, and ritual planning.
- **Blueprint library**: Curated activation kits per biome with pinning support.
- **Commons marketplace**: Narrative listings for tools, amendments, and residencies.
- **Network pulse**: Conversational feed that spotlights collaborative threads across the guild.
- **Responsive shell**: Automatically switches between a navigation rail and bottom navigation.

## Tech Stack

- Flutter 3 / Dart 3
- `provider` for lightweight state management
- `fl_chart` for the animated soil pulse visualization
- `google_fonts` for custom typography
- `intl` for friendly date formatting

## Development

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run -d chrome   # or your preferred device
```

## Assets & Customization

- Update `pubspec.yaml` to register additional assets or fonts.
- Modify `lib/main.dart` to adjust the experimental data, copy, or flows.
- Web metadata (title, manifest, splash) lives under the `web/` directory.
